(Bugs)
- In really small screen and old screens the labels may break line.
	* We could make the font really small (bad for reading?).
	* We could change the labels text for mobile devices.

- Input number accepts letters and shows empty string in test
	* check keypress and clear non numeric values.
	* or change to input text and check with isNaN.

- Large values don't resize when they are bigget than the screen's width
	* create a rule to change the font size according the length of the number
	* or use css to break line (easier but no as good looking).

(Improvements)
- Animations: The site could use animations on showing results, errors, etc..

- Remove button calculate and show values as they are typed

- Add a number mask separating the thousands?
